Hello coders, in week 13 we wrap up the course by opening a toolkit that will carry you well beyond these lessons. First, you will learn how to create and activate virtual environments so every project keeps its own clean set of libraries. From there we will explore panNDAS data frames, powerful tables that make it easy to load, philtre, and transform relational data. Finally, you will draw quick visual summaries with matplotlib, turning numbers into clear plots in just a few lines. By the end of this week, you'll have a working workflow, isolated environments, tidy data tables, and simple charts that sets the stage for deeper Python and data science work. Let's get started.

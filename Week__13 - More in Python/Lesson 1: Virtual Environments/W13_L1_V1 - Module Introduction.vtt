Hello coders, in week 13 we wrap up the
course by opening a toolkit that will

2
00:00:15.489 --> 00:00:19.850
carry you well beyond these lessons.
First, you will learn how to create and

3
00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:24.440
activate virtual environments so every
project keeps its own clean set of

4
00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:29.819
libraries. From there we will explore
panNDAS data frames, powerful tables

5
00:00:29.819 --> 00:00:35.369
that make it easy to load, philtre, and
transform relational data. Finally, you

6
00:00:35.369 --> 00:00:39.950
will draw quick visual summaries with
matplotlib, turning numbers into clear

7
00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:45.169
plots in just a few lines. By the end
of this week, you'll have a working

8
00:00:45.169 --> 00:00:50.290
workflow, isolated environments, tidy
data tables, and simple charts that

9
00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:54.630
sets the stage for deeper Python and
data science work. Let's get started.
